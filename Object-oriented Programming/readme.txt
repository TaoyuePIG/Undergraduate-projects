Here is my course project of the object-oriented programming.
We are asked to develop an email management system.

As the team leader, I led 4 people to develop this software to realize the following functions:
• User registration: Can log in or register new user. Data is stored in SQLite database.
• Sending & Receiving: Can send and receive emails with attachments to every third party’s email
address via POP3/SMTP protocol. The contents are encoded by base64 and encrypted by SSL.
• Spam identification: Can identify spams via naive Bayesian classifier automatically.
• GUI: Used the framework of Qt graphical user interface based on C++.
