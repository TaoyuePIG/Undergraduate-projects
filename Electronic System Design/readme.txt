Here are several selected projects of electronic system.

1. Intelligent Socket
- A power socket for 2-way controllable switch.
- Have USB power supply interface.
- Support WiFi remote control.
- Telemetry on switch voltage, temperature and current values.
- Support remote control via an Android App.


2. Multi-channel Competition Responder
- At the same time, 8 contestants can be provided to participate in the competition, and the group number displayed on the button is 1-8;
- The host controls the reset, reset and start of the system through the control switch;
- The responder has the function of data locking and group number display, which can judge the illegal answering, that is, answering in advance before the host starts the start button;
- After the host presses the start button, the timer counts down and displays the remaining time. The contestants will answer the questions within the set time. Once there are competitors, the timer will stop counting immediately. If there is still no rush to answer when the time is up, it will stop at 0s after sending a 1s prompt tone. The preemptive answer will be invalid, and the input circuit will be blocked and overtime rush answer is prohibited. The answer time can be preset by the host within 1~99s;
- Scoring circuit: each group at the beginning of the preset 10 points, after rushing to answer by the host control, correct answer plus 1 point, wrong answer minus 1 point.


3. Multi-functional Digital Clock
- Designed with Arduino UNO, DS1302 clock chip, LCD monitor, temperature sensor, Dupont threads, bread board.
- Show the real time and date with an LCD monitor.
- Can strike the hour and set an alarm clock.
- Detect the temperature and give an alarm if it is higher then the set value.
- Press the button to switch the function mode and adapt the value.
